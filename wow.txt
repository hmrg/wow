SPECIAL INPUTS    //to be used during in-game conversations, item USE specifics. regular commands will not apply during inputs
  e.g. How many? [qty, integer],  Select convo. option [integer value choice],  stored variable names


  
LOCATIONS
  for each location, the following commands are always available: 
  LOOK
  GO TO
  TALK (If characters are around to be spoken with. Must be near the person (via 'GO TO [PERSON]'-- the game will make fun of you if not    //You strike up a conversation from across the room. [PERSON] puts their hand to their ear like a granny. Maybe you should try getting closer to talk?)
  HINT  (Hints are specific to the current location, and mention any items that have yet to be collected in the current area. In the case of HANK and CHEESE, which require TASTY DIRT and MAP, respectively, to obtain, the hint will give guidance on the items that are needed. e.g. entering HINT at CHICKEN COOP reads: 'Hank wants some tasty dirt to eat!'
  Once both items have been obtained in an area, HINT command output defaults to 'We're all done here! Let's mosey somewhere else.')
  
  
  special dialogues may sometimes display the first time a location is visited, or when certain parameters are met. these will be the 'cutscenes' for the game (e.g. BEDROOM during the game intro).
  
  on entering a location, a brief location description will display. more information, like items in the area or objects that should be inspected, will be mentioned when player uses LOOK [AROUND].
  
  both wives will need specific ITEMS that will make them happy for the perfect romantic day. ITEMS are obtained throughout the following areas:
  
  BEDROOM
  LIVING ROOM
  YARD
  CHICKEN COOP

SCRIPT

INTRO

text scroll intro: (w/ music)
  It's February 20XX. 
  The most romantic day of the year 
  is right around the corner.
  That's right: February 14th...
  Smoochin' Times Day.
  
  You are a strapping young butch
  with two whole wives. Show them
  that you love them a lot 
  by finding the perfect gifts.
  Hurry-- or else you might just
  become the World's Wimpiest Wife!
  
  

LOCATION-SPECIFIC

LOCATION: BEDROOM (Special - Intro)

  You awake in your bed, surrounded by wives. Weak winter sunlight fills the room with muted colors. 

  LOOK: 
  
  Some mornings you like to just lie there and hear them breathing. 
  
  LOOK: 
  GO TO: 
  TALK: 
  HINT: 
  
  
  
  
LOCATION: OVERLOOK

  The dirt smells super tasty here.
  
  
  
  
LOCATION: LIVING ROOM

  wife1 will be sitting here. game can be concluded by speaking to her. 
    once HANK is in your inventory, and you speak to wife1, you can give her HANK right away. HANK will then sit on the arm of the sofa next to her until the end of the game
      when hank is on the sofa, talking to wife1 gives you the option to say hi to HANK. HANK will beep (sound fx).


LOCATION: YARD
LOCATION: CHICKEN COOP

LOCATION: CAR

  You can head all kinds of places with this sweet ride. Where will you go?
  1. Home     (transports to YARD)
  2. Campus   (transports to CAMPUS landing screen)
  3. The Devil's House
  4. The Cool Spot
  5. The Store

     when the player is at a certain location (e.g. they enter the CAR while at home in the YARD), the current location's spot on the numbered list will instead be replaced by the option 'Get out'. Choosing this option will transport the player from the CAR to the current location.
	 
	 when a number is chosen, the action dialogue reads 'Let's roll!' and then transports the player to the chosen location.
	 if a number is entered that is not within the prompt range (1-5), output dialogue 'Whoa there, buddy! Stick to a number on the list.'

  LOOK: Here it is: your super sweet dykemobile, the 1984 Volkswagen Rabbit. Hatchback. Two doors. Five speeds. One satisfying ride. It's taken you across the country dozens of times. The smell of the interior reminds you of roadtrips with your wives. You recently cleaned the car out, though some of wife1's things are still in the CENTER CONSOLE. What you didn't throw out, you stuffed in the GLOVEBOX. Clean enough, I guess.
  GO TO: ('home', 'campus,' '[the] devil's house', '[the] cool spot', and '[the] store', in addition to numbers 1-5, will work for transporting the player with the GO TO COMMAND. simply typing one of the numbers on the list will do the same.)
